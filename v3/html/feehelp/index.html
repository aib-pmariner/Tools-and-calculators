        <h2>How this calculator works</h2>
        <p>This calculator is intended as an educational tool. It uses the following assumptions and methodology to provide you with an indication about how much take home pay you may have and any potential shortfall. All examples shown in this tool are illustrative and do not represent an estimate or guarantee. Your take home pay may be very different to any of the outputs generated by this calculator.</p>
        <h2>No individual assumptions:</h2>
        <p>This calculator does not take into account your personal eligibility, tax obligations, objectives, your financial situation and needs and other unpredictable events that may alter your weekly take home pay.</p>
        <h2>No tax or CPI assumptions:</h2>
        <p>Any amounts are shown in today’s dollars without any tax or CPI considerations or adjustments whatsoever. </p>
        <h2>2017-2018 StudyAssist repayment rates</h2>
        <p>The calculator used the StudyAssist repayment rates provided in the 2017-2018 table available <a href="http://studyassist.gov.au/sites/studyassist/payingbackmyloan/loan-repayment/pages/loan-repayment">here</a>.</p>
